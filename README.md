# Name-Entity-Recognition
Name entity recognition using LSTMs and pre trained word vectors from GLOVE model in Tensorflow.

# Dataset
Download the dataset from this link https://github.com/dice-group/FOX/tree/master/input/Wikiner.

# Pre trained word vectors
Link to download the Glove model https://nlp.stanford.edu/projects/glove/. There are different models with different vector dimension. I have used the 50 dimension vector for faster performance.
